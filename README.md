# Password Strength Evaluation – Task 6

## Objective

To evaluate the strength of custom-created passwords using online password strength checkers, and understand best practices in creating secure passwords.

---

## What Makes a Password Strong?

A strong password should be:

- At least **12 to 16 characters** long
- A mix of **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters**
- **Random** (not based on dictionary words or personal info)
- **Unique** (not reused across sites)

## Evaluation Summary

| Password Index | Complexity Level   | Tool Score (Approx) | Notes                                      |
|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1              | Very Strong         | ~95–100%             | Excellent length and character variety     |
| 2              | Strong              | ~85%                 | Includes recognizable phrase               |
| 3              | Extremely Strong    | 100%                 | Very high entropy and randomness           |
| 4              | Strong              | ~80–85%              | Good use of symbols, slightly shorter      |
| 5              | Very Strong         | ~90–95%              | Long and complex with mixed characters     |

## Examples of Weak Passwords

| Weak Password  | Reason It’s Insecure                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `123456`       | Common, purely numeric                            |
| `password`     | Found in most breached password lists             |
| `admin123`     | Generic username + number                         |
| `qwertyuiop`   | Keyboard pattern, predictable                     |
| `welcome2024`  | Common word and year combo                        |
| `iloveyou`     | Easily guessable phrase                           |
| `abc123`       | Simple, sequential pattern                        |
| `name@123`     | Includes personal info + basic pattern            |

## Common Password Attacks

1. **Brute Force Attack**
   - Tries every possible character combination.
   - Time to crack increases exponentially with length and character diversity.

2. **Dictionary Attack**
   - Uses lists of common passwords or real words.
   - Fails against random or complex passwords.

3. **Credential Stuffing**
   - Attempts logins using known breached credentials.
   - Reusing passwords across sites increases risk.

---

## How Password Complexity Affects Security

- **Longer passwords** with mixed character types have higher entropy.
- A 16-character password using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols has **quadrillions** of combinations.
- Randomness ensures resistance against dictionary-based and brute-force attacks.

---

## Best Practices Learned

- Avoid using **names**, **dictionary words**, or **keyboard patterns**
- Use **at least 12 characters**
- Mix **symbols, numbers, uppercase and lowercase**
- Use **different passwords** for each account
- Prefer **password managers** to generate/store complex passwords

---

## Conclusion

Creating strong, complex, and unique passwords is essential for digital security. Simple or reused passwords are vulnerable to various attacks, while long, random, and diverse passwords offer significant resistance. Password managers are strongly recommended to maintain both security and usability.
